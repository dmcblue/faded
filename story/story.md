An unknown disaster called 'The Horror'(WC) begins plaguing the city.  The Monarch calls all the people into the castle to protect them and researches a solution.  Tries several things, some dark, some with dire warnings.  One of them is summoning an entity 'Kataban', named a genie/spirit but actually an evil/demon, who can give the Monarch an army strong enough to conquer the world.  We find out later the Horror was loosed by Kataban to cause this.  On summoning, Kataban offers to give the Monarch the power to help them.  Once the Monarch accepts, the people are turned? and the Monarch is placed under obligation/cursed.
The Monarch loses track of itself, spending days in the castle trying to rescue those who enter from the cursed.  The Monarch's magical/mental energy is thrown apart by continually going mad, creating the candles.

## Four Options/Thrones:

- Conquerer - You accept the curse of Kataban, becoming the leader of its army on earth, destroying the Horror? in exchange for your free will.  You regain your power (collect all the candles and stop losing light).  You break free of the castle with your army of undead, destroying every town and city in your wake, placing the entire world under the shadow of Kataban.
- Saint - Monarch is destroyed
