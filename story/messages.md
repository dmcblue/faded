# Game Story

You find yourself in a dark (castle, dungeon, netherland).  You feel your life fading out.
Wandering the dungeon, you find a candle.  Taking it, you feel the light of the candle filling your soul.  You feel a bit stronger; you can see a bit farther.  The candle is gone.  But still, your life force is still fading slowly out.
As your energy leaves you, the room gets darker.

People go into the castle of the Dread Monarch to steal treasure. The messages lead you to believe you are a treasure hunter.  They also tell, slowly, the truth of the Dread Monarch.  They were cursed to become a Lich and lead the darkness against the people of the kingdom.  But the Monarch fights the curse and stays in the castle to protect their subjects. It is slowly revealed that you are in fact the Dread Monarch and you are losing your battle against the curse.
