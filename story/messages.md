# Game Story

You find yourself in a dark (castle, dungeon, netherland).  You feel your life fading out.
Wandering the dungeon, you find a candle.  Taking it, you feel the light of the candle filling your soul.  You feel a bit stronger; you can see a bit farther.  The candle is gone.  But still, your life force is still fading slowly out.
As your energy leaves you, the room gets darker.

People go into the castle of the Dread Monarch to steal treasure. The messages lead you to believe you are a treasure hunter.  They also tell, slowly, the truth of the Dread Monarch.  They were cursed to become a Lich and lead the darkness against the people of the kingdom.  But the Monarch fights the curse and stays in the castle to protect their subjects. It is slowly revealed that you are in fact the Dread Monarch and you are losing your battle against the curse.

Wizard figures it out and writes that the Traveller is the Dread Monarch

You awake in a dark, stone-tiled room.  Your head throbs and you can feel your life slowly draining away.  Distant lights shine dimly in the blackness and strange groans echo from unseen places.

I entered the Dark Castle three days ago with a team 10 strong.  I am alone now.  8 are dead.  Marian is alive, I believe, but we were separated in an attack.  I heard his voice yelling from far away yesterday; I think he has gone mad.  What folie let us to think we could find a power here to save our village?

Marn and Hauran are dead. The rumors of treasures in this abandoned fortress...don't matter anymore.  The legions of undead here never tire.  I must keep moving hour after hour to stay ahead of them. The exit...I can't find it again. Has it disappeared? Am I crazy?
- Sen Hain

I can feel my life fading...The candles...The candles...

On my travels here, I encountered some mercenaries fleeing the carnage.  They spoke of the 'Dread Monarch' who rose up in the castle during the chaos and who now reigns in darkness and death.  Warriors, experienced on many battlefields, spoke of the Dread Monarch in furtive whispers with downcast faces, carrying a fear which still plagued them. As soon as I entered this dark castle, I could feel a terrible presence and knew their words to be true.

We have successfully entered the 'Dark Castle'. How many have tried their luck in these halls, hunting for treasures in its belly?  I suspect such adventurers are the only one's to enter here in decades.  I feel so proud to walk where so many of my brethren have walked, but where they have failed or fled, I will prevail.

Why am I here?  Was I explorer like the others? No other explanation. I awoke in the darkness only find the tattered pages of those before me.  What fate did I suffer?  How am I still alive among these horrors?

12 of Naivarn, 952
Indeed, the brief report from Awalat has proved true.  I can only imagine what fate the young mage suffered here.  Wretched undead roam the hallways seeking the rend the flesh of the living.  By their clothing, I fear they are the former denizens of the abandoned town just outside.  But they seem bound by these walls; some power holds them here.  I can sense it is not a benevolent force; evil reigns here.  But if so, why keep such dark creatures restrained here?  Something is unfinished in this castle...
- Grand Magus Uial of the Torin

The siege continues.  The Horror is held back only by the gates of the town.  Everyone has been brought within the gates, but I fear we may need to bring everyone inside the castle walls soon. Our beloved Monarch continues searching every possible means to save our people.  Every possible means.  I fear such research will led us to something darker than even the Horror...

I would and have done anything. What parent wouldn't, for a sick child? Sicker and sicker each day.  The fables in our town all lead back to the Dread Monarch, a figure meant to scare children when they are unruly.  The story goes that all ill and evil stems from the Dread Monarch, who sacrificed the people for power and immortality centuries ago.  Fables.  But the forest of my grandfather's time is turning to swamp and strange noises echo in the night.  The children are getting sick with something fearful and wrong and they do not get better. By following the foulness tainting the land, I found the Dark Castle. I did not really believe it existed. But if it exists, then the the legendary Monarch must as well.  So now I promise and I pray to kill this Dread Monarch and end this wretchedness. For my child.

My suspicions were true. There is a demonic presence here, something far beyond human. Whether I have its identity correct remains to be seen. I pray I am wrong. Otherwise, this dark place, these horrors and abominations are only the beginning. My only hope is that I can alert the Enclave in time.

Fire-eater. Fire-eater. Eats the fire. Little fire, little fire. EAT EAT EAT. Til they are all eaten up, the Fire-eater gets BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT. But if it gets DARK DARK DARK, then BOOM.  And all the little fires run away til the Fire-eater wakes up and eats eats eats.
- Marian

I mustered power enough to briefly report to the Enclave. But the power here must have sensed it; I can no longer make contact.  I pray, if I do not escape, that my notes will be of use to them.  As I ascending the castle, more dark creatures appeared, all formed from the former inhabitants.  One such are the Handmaidens of the castle.  They have been transformed in to tortured spirits, consumed by grief.  In their sorrow, they do not notice intruders but their mere presence is a danger.  As they passed by, I could feel my life draining and I had to fallback to a safe distance. May they be released from this curse.

The undead attacked as soon as I entered the castle.  The legends all fall short of the true horrors hidden within these walls.  I tried to run but the monsters were everywhere. I fell. I knew my fate as they ripped apart my flesh.  Then a light filled the room.  Through the blood, I saw a bright figure calling to the undead.  They charged after it, ravenous for another meal, and the figure ran down a hallway.  An inch from death, I passed out.  When I awoke, I found myself in an alcove, hidden from the undead.  How did I get here? As I peered into the long hallway, I saw the bright figure disappearing up a stairwell.  Was it the one who saved me?  Does it know a means of escape? When I regained my strength, I ascended the same steps and have been following its trail ever since.
- T. Sinhuan

The candles, the figure of light all the journals speak of, what do they have to do with this place?  Can I find this person? Can they help me?

What happened here so long ago? Why am I here?

On the second day, I found a library with piles of notes everywhere.  All on subjects of summoning great power; someone seemed desperate, dangerous or mad. Among them I finally found the word I've been searching for all these years, 'Kataban'. As the notes say, the powerful spirit who resides in the realm of the dead and loves games and wagers.  Anyone who summons Kataban may ask for aid from the spirit's powers, which overshadow all magics in the living realms. If I find the source these notes come from, I have found all I shall ever need on this earth!

I found Awalat. Put up a mighty fight, from the looks of it.  The young mage would have been Grand Magus in but a few years with such talents; Archmage before long.  The final straw seemed to have been the Nobles.  While the townspeople are merely mindless undead, the nobility of the castle have been transformed into cruelly ravenous creatures.  Their speed is incredible. And as soon as they attack, they disappear, only to charge out of the darkness again.  A foul death for such a noble mage as Awalat.

The Monarch has locked the doors to the throne room, warning me the experiments inside were highly dangerous.  Our Majesty has had a more positive mood since finding a strange book in the library.  I have never seen it before, despite wandering those shelves a thousand times.  The Monarch says the book tells of a spirit, Kataban, who may yet save us but may ask a high price.  Our Majesty seems prepared for whatever self-sacrifice is necessary to save the people. My admiration knows no bounds. I inquired about safety and the response was that the power of the four Thrones of the Ancestors would be sufficient. But the Monarch's grim expression as the throne room door closed left me feeling uneasy. I said loudly as it shut that I would help in anyway, whatever the danger.

As I sit in this darkness, my very life flees me in despair. My people forever tormented. The thrones of my ancestors corrupted by the terrible choices that awaits me above.  I cannot face this decision nor the people that I have failed.
- (illegible), Monarch of (illegible)

There is a truth here I cannot admit. As I find more and more details...how many times have I read these words?  I pray it isn't true.  Let there be an end to these terrible halls and for all that they contain.

I found the book of summoning, finally. But when I opened the page for the great spirit, the word 'Betrayer' was written by hand over and over upon the instructions.  A loose page stuffed inside contained a passage copied from another book: "From 'Lost Powers of Ancient Ages': Kataban, ancient demon of trickery, delights in torturing souls with dreadful choices. Beware lest ye call on this evil, for Kataban's word, though always kept and true, never fails to contain a hidden damnation for the unwary soul." There is no hope for our village. But truly I would prefer our village perish than to suffer the evils that have taken this place.

After two days of rituals, the Monarch burst out of the throne room and worked in the library for two days more, not stopping for sleep.  Then returned to the throne room for an hour more, when I heard yelling within.  I forced the doors open only to find the Monarch, sitting horror stuck on the throne, muttering over and over "The Horror is the servant, Kataban the Lord and we, the fools." I tried to help the Monarch up, but was pushed away as Our Majesty ran from the room. I fell against the throne and a chill coursed through my body.  I hear dreadful noises from below and something wretched is happening within me. Where has Our Monarch gone?  May we yet be saved...
- Steward Maurin

14 of Auvur, 950
It has worked! The ritual contacted the spirit and it agreed to summon a vast army of aide. In return, Kataban asked me merely to answer a riddle concerning the question, "Who are you?".  These spirits are strange but it is a small matter if it brings safety to my people.  I make haste now to study the spirit's history to best answer the riddle.

I found the body of a Grand Magus from the Torin Enclave.  How foolish have I been to enter these halls? If a Grand Magus cannot stand against the evils here, what chance do I have?  I read the Torin's journal and I understand why this place is so forgotten. Unable to break the evils here, he spent his last hours setting magical wards to turn aside the interest of travelers and to warn mages of the dangers within.  This last act delayed him long enough for the Steward to find him and deliver a mortal blow. There is no escape, such will be my fate too I suppose...
