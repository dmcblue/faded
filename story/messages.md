# Game Story

You find yourself in a dark (castle, dungeon, netherland).  You feel your life fading out.
Wandering the dungeon, you find a candle.  Taking it, you feel the light of the candle filling your soul.  You feel a bit stronger; you can see a bit farther.  The candle is gone.  But still, your life force is still fading slowly out.
As your energy leaves you, the room gets darker.

People go into the castle of the Dread Monarch to steal treasure. The messages lead you to believe you are a treasure hunter.  They also tell, slowly, the truth of the Dread Monarch.  They were cursed to become a Lich and lead the darkness against the people of the kingdom.  But the Monarch fights the curse and stays in the castle to protect their subjects. It is slowly revealed that you are in fact the Dread Monarch and you are losing your battle against the curse.

Wizard figures it out and writes that the Traveller is the Dread Monarch

You awake in a dark, stone-tiled room.  Your head throbs and you can feel your life slowly draining away.  Distant lights shine dimly in the blackness and strange groans echo from unseen places.

I entered the Dark Castle three days ago with a team 10 strong.  I am alone now.  8 are dead.  Marian is alive, I believe, but we were separated in an attack.  I heard his voice yelling from far away yesterday; I think he has gone mad.  What folie let us to think we could find a power here to save our village?

Marn and Hauran are dead. The rumors of treasures in this abandoned fortress...don't matter anymore.  The legions of undead here never tire.  I must keep moving hour after hour to stay ahead of them. The exit...I can't find it again. Has it disappeared? Am I crazy?
- Sen Hain

I can feel my life fading...The candles...The candles...

On my travels here, I encountered some mercenaries fleeing the carnage.  They spoke of the 'Dread Monarch' who rose up in the castle during the chaos and who now reigns in darkness and death.  Warriors, experienced on many battlefields, spoke of the Dread Monarch in furtive whispers with downcast faces, carrying a fear which still plagued them. As soon as I entered this dark castle, I could feel a terrible presence and knew their words to be true.

We have successfully entered the 'Dark Castle'. How many have tried their luck in these halls, hunting for treasures in its belly?  I suspect such adventurers are the only one's to enter here in decades.  I feel so proud to walk where so many of my brethren have walked, but where they have failed or fled, I will prevail.

Why am I here?  Was I explorer like the others? No other explanation. I awoke in the darkness only find the tattered pages of those before me.  What fate did I suffer?  How am I still alive among these horrors?

Fire-eater. Fire-eater. Eats the fire. Little fire, little fire. EAT EAT EAT. Til they are all eaten up, the Fire-eater gets BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT. But if it gets DARK DARK DARK, then BOOM.  And all the little fires run away til the Fire-eater wakes up and eats eats eats.
